# Virtual Internship - Android Development Basics Using Kotlin


# GroceryApp
Grocery App is a list app to put all your grocery names quantities, etc.
Although there are plenty of already existing grocery apps, this app uses simple user interface.

In this project, we are using Model View ViewModel for architectural patterns, Room API for database
and coroutines and RecyclerView to display the list of items.

# What IS Model View ViewModel(MVVM)
MVVM architecture in android is used to give structure to the project's code and understand code easily. MVVm is
an architecturall design pattern in android. MVVM treat activity classes and XML files as view.
This design pattern completely separate UI from its logic.

# ROOM DATABASE
Room persistence library is a database management library and it is used to store the data of apps like
grocery item name, grocery item quantity and item price. Room is cover layer on SQLitte which helps to perform
the operation on the database easily.

# RecyclerView
RecyclerView is a container and it is used to display the collection of data in a large amount of data set that can be scrolled very effectively by maintaining a limited number of views.

# Coroutines 
Coroutines are a lightweight thread, we use a coroutine to perform an operation on other threads, by this our main thread
doesn't block and our app doesn't crash.
